1. INSTALLATION MODES: Hadoop portal provides user with a way to setup their cluster first
                       before they can do administraion over it. It provides three installation modes:
                       a) Typical Installation: Typical mode as its name sounds, provides the user with automatic
                          install feature which can be compared with one click cluster setup with the optimal settings
                          which the automation scripts will do it automatically for you.

                      b) Customised Installation: Customised mode feature is for advanced users which provides
                         them with the feature of tweaking and tuning their cluster according to their needs.
                         
                      c) Minimal Installation: Minimal installation is the feature for those who wants to learn
                        hadoop (beginners). It setup the cluster on the standalone machine viz. also called as pseudo
                        cluster.
                      
                      
LOOKING UNDER DIFFERENT INSTALLATION MODES:
TYPICAL INSTALLATION:
                      Welcome Typical.html : On this page user will be asked IP of NIS server and NFS Server.
                        Since this is just a beta version we are using NIS server for authentication purpose, 
                        in upcoming versions we can also use LDAP servers.
                        On clicking Start user will be taken back to next page.
                      
                      FinishedT.html: This page is the confirmation page which will give the status of installation
                        process. It does not do much as in typical installation user is not asked about anything about 
                        the cluster.
                        On clicking Finalize button. User will be taken to login page from where user can administer
                        the cluster.

                        What happend in the background ?
                        
                        After clicking the Start button on Welcome Typical.html , provided IP's of NIS and NFS server
                        is given to the setupTypical.py script through the CGI call and NIS and NFS servers will be
                        automatically setup in along with the cluster, and then these servers can be used during user
                        authentication and user quota setup in the background.
